<h1>Magura HS33 Hydraulic Rim Brake</h1>

<p>
	If you're into bikes, then you probably know about Magura Brakes. <br />
	Magura is a german company, which produces premium hydraulic brakes for bikes and motorbikes as well.<br />
	They are quite something else, and in terms of rim brakes I believe they are the best brakes in the world.<br />
	As a news flash: Magura recently introduced rim brakes for road bikes. They cost a lot and they look so cool, and probably stop you on a dime. They started to pop up even in the Tour de France. There isn't better marketing then that. <br />
</p>
<p>
	These “made in Germany” brakes haven't changed a lot during the years.<br />
	They got the great design right on the first time and they stuck with it. 
</p>
<p>
	In term of rim brakes (except the road bike version), they have the HS11, the HS33 and the HS33 Firm Tech.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The Magura HS11 are the entry level brakes, and they come on city bikes, trekking bikes, great stopping power.
	</li>
	<li>
		The Magura HS33 are the most powerful, you can find them on XC mountain bikes, trial bikes, touring bikes loaded with a tone of kit, tandem bikes, unicycles. The difference between Magura HS33 and Magura HS11 is that the HS33 leaver has a bigger cylinder, thus being more powerful. 
	</li>
	<li>
		The Firm Tech model is designed to work only with Magura forks, they are the lightest because they have a different design, and they don't use mounting plates and brake boosters
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Magura brakes work?&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear you ask.</h2>
<p>
	There is a hydraulic circuit from the leavers to the brake pads.<br />
	Its simple: When pushing the brake leaver -the master cylinder in the leaver compresses fluid in the slave cylinders (which are mounted on the fork canti studs), and the slave cylinders pushes the brake pads.<br />
	The pads are pushed parallel  to the rim and they give you the best rim braking performance in the world.<br />
</p>
<h2>Magura HS33 hydraulic rim brakes versus V brakes</h2>
<p>
	Off course there are some downfalls: the bigger price tag of the Magura's, the initial setup is a bit time consuming, and there is the grams factor. My actual Magura's weights 900 grams + 90 grams Magura brake boosters.
	A good V brake setup let's say: Avid SD7 (380gr)+ Avid leavers (350gr)+ some AL boosters (60) + wires and housing and noodles (50) it ads up to 840 grams.
</p>
A 160 gram penalty isn't that bad considering the benefits of the hydraulic rim brake:<br />
<ul>
	<li>
		better modulation
	</li>
	<li>
		no maintenance
	</li>
	<li>
		huge braking power
	</li>
	<li>
		easy leaver action – one finger or two fingers
	</li>
	<li>
		no more manual brake pad adjusting (the Magura has a TPA knob, wich adjusts the pads directly from the leaver )
	</li>
	<li>
		better fiability – once installed you forget about them
	</li>
	<li>
		the coolness factor – you have a great quality piece of german engineering, and its made in Germany not Malaysia
	</li>
	<li>
		no more rusting brake cables getting stuck and gunked up wioth dirt and grease
	</li>
	<li>
		no cables or housing getting loose
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Almost all of the touring bikes made in Germany come equipped with Magura HS33 brakes.
	Magura has great support on their site, they have a forum, they have the manuals available at a click of a button. Also Magura parts are available, ensuring a long life for your braking system.
</p>

<h2>The Magura brake pads</h2>
Magura offers different types of pads, depending on the intended use and type of rim you are using:
<ul>
	<li>
		normal black pads
	</li>
	<li>
		racing red pads
	</li>
	<li>
		normal black pads for rims that have a ceramic coating
	</li>
	<li>
		racing red pads for rims that have a ceramic coating
	</li>
</ul>
You can also find a multitude of after market pads.<br />
<p>
	Some trial riders, instead of using the recommended MAGURA ROYAL BLOOD mineral
	oil, they use water, for a better modulation. How cool are these brakes :D.<br />
	In fact it is stated in the manual: “In the case of an emergency, cooking oil will work, but needs to be flushed out after the return to civilization.”
</p>
<p>
	In the age of disk brakes, I still use my trusty Magura HS33's, and I don't think I'll be changing them soon.
</p>
<p>
	Originally my german bike was equipped with Magura HS33. During the last 3 years I've tried Avid SD3 V brakes, Shimano Deore LX V brakes, Avid Single Digit 7 V brakes, and now I'm using Magura HS33's again – the latest design.<br />
	You can't beat the HS33, there's simply no competition.
</p>
<p>
    This are my actual Magura HS33 hydraulic rim brakes fitted on my XC ride.<br />
	Initially they came with only the Magura mounting plate, but that wasn't enough to stop the flex in the fork. So I mounted some older model Magura Boosters for extra stiffness. That fixed the flexi forks problem, and made my front fork more stiffer. Light weight forks tend to flex a lot.
</p>
<p>
	Here are side to side 2 different Magura HS33 models:

</p>
<p>
	The Evolution and the EVO2.<br />
	The older model (Silver) has a different leaver, the TPA is also different.<br />
	The newer one (Black) has the TPA more tucked away, so preventing accidental brakage.<br />
	The Slave cylinders look the same.
	The mounting is different: the EVO2 has a mounting plate, the Evolution has some plastic studs/legs that stick against the forks preventing the movement of the whole assembly.
